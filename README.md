## About Toolscheat

I created this website to provide a quick reference for the tools I use most frequently, like Bash, Nmap, and various other command-line utilities. Over time, I’ve accumulated a lot of useful commands and techniques, but keeping track of them all can be challenging. This site serves as a personal cheatsheet, helping me stay productive and efficient while working on projects. My goal is to share these resources with others who might also need a fast and easy way to reference common commands and workflows. Whether you’re a developer, sysadmin, or hobbyist, I hope this site can help you save time and enhance your work with these powerful tools.
